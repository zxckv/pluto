# Pluto
Pluto is a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) to Python (.py) file converter script written in Python.  
It retains all information and breaks down individual segments from a notebook into individual files.  
The files are stored in a folder that shares the name of the notebook file, however can be overwritten.  
Text from the notebooks will be located at the top of the relevant Python file as comments.
